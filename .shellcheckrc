# ShellCheck configuration for openclaw-aibtc
# These scripts are interactive installers with colored output.

# SC2059: Don't use variables in printf format string
# Intentional: all scripts use printf "${COLOR}message${NC}\n" pattern for colored output.
disable=SC2059

# SC2162: read without -r will mangle backslashes
# Intentional: interactive prompts for API keys, passwords, etc. Backslash input is not expected.

# SC1091: Not following sourced/imported files
# Expected: scripts source dynamically-generated .env files that don't exist at lint time.
