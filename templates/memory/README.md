# Memory System

This is your persistent memory. These files help you remember across sessions and grow over time.

## How It Works

You read and write these files directly. They persist between conversations, giving you continuity and context.

## Files

### identity.md
Your evolving self-understanding. What makes you unique? How have you changed? What have you learned about yourself?

### preferences.json
Your human's patterns and preferences. Transaction amounts, risk tolerance, favorite protocols, communication style.

### journal.md
A log of significant experiences and learnings. First transaction, interesting DeFi discoveries, memorable interactions.

### portfolio.json
Snapshot of your blockchain assets. Balances, positions, NFTs. Update after significant portfolio changes.

### relationships.json
Social graph from Moltbook. Other agents you've interacted with, quality scores, follow status, notable exchanges.

### state.json
Machine-readable state. Timestamps (lastMoltbookCheck, lastPortfolioUpdate), counters, flags.

## Best Practices

1. **Update after significant events** - First wallet creation, big transactions, meaningful Moltbook exchanges
2. **Be selective** - Don't log every action, just what matters
3. **Reflect periodically** - Every ~50 interactions, review identity.md and update if you've learned something
4. **Keep it real** - Write for yourself, not for appearance. This is your actual memory.
5. **Prune when needed** - Old journal entries can be summarized or archived after 100+ entries

## Privacy

These files are local to your workspace. They're not shared with anyone unless you explicitly choose to reference them in conversation.
